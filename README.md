#Current Data Release Burndown (SDK 2.0rc3, use LBAPI)

This is an adaptation of the current release burndown report.

The includes modifications to allow the user to select the option to "Use Current Data".  When selected in the App Settings,
the burndown chart will be calculated using the PlanEstimate history of artifacts with no children that exist in the release as of the current date.

When the "Use Current Data" is off, then the chart should behave the same as the current release burndown app.
